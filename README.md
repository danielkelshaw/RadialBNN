# RadialBNN

PyTorch implementation of **[Radial Bayesian Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00865)**

This repository provides an implementation of the theory described in
the [Radial Bayesian Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00865)
paper. The code provides a PyTorch interface which ensures that the
modules developed can be used in conjunction with other components of
a neural network.
